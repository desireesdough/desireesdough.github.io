      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>Hi! I'm Desiree, a stay-at-home-mom that fell into the world of sourdough almost 2 years ago. After a period of trying all kinds of baking combinations to find what works (or often what <em>doesn't</em> work), I finally felt confident to share with friends and family. They loved my loaves so much they urged me to share them with others and that's what I hope to do here!</p>

      <h3>Fresh-Baked to Order</h3>
      <p>Unlike a store or market that bakes a selection of goods each day for you to decide from, I bake your custom orders fresh the day you pickup! By ordering directly from me, I also attempt to keep my costs lower than what you find at the markets. Every dough uses a base of unbleached flour, water, and salt. Flavors vary monthly and I rotate to keep things interesting! So keep an eye as the menu changes and snag new flavors before they are gone! :)</p>
