      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>Hi! I'm Desiree, a SAHM with a bit of a sourdough obsession. I always knew I wanted to try baking sourdough so when I finally procured a good starter a couple years ago I dove right into it. After a period of trying all kinds of cooking combinations to find what works (or often what <em>doesn't</em> work), I finally felt confident to share with family and friends. They loved my loaves so much they urged me to share them with others and that's what I hope to do here!</p>

      <h3>Fresh-Baked to Order</h3>
      <p>Unlike a store or market that bakes a selection of goods each day for you to decide from, I bake your custom orders fresh! This means that you always get exactly what you want. It also means I need orders in advance since it takes approximately 48 hours to ferment and work the dough for baking. I only use quality ingredients and even take fresh herbs from my own garden when available, ensuring fresh and delicious results each time!</p>
